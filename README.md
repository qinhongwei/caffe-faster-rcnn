# Special Feature for My Caffe 

- Clone from the official caffe, will continuely be up to date by the official caffe code
- Faster rcnn joint train and test \[DONE\]
- Action recognition (Two Stream) \[DONE\]
- With demos including above tasks ^_^

## Faster RCNN End-To-End

### Disclaimer
The official Faster R-CNN code (written in MATLAB) is [available](https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn) here. If your goal is to reproduce the results in our NIPS 2015 paper, please use the [official](https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn) code.

This repository contains a C++ reimplementation of the Python code([py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn)). This C++ implementation is built on the offcial [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe), I will continue to update this code for improvement and up-to-date by offcial caffe.

All following steps, you should do these in the $CAFFE\_ROOT path.

### Demo
Using **sh example/FRCNN/demo\_frcnn.sh**, the will process five pictures in the examples/FRCNN/images , and put results into examples/FRCNN/results .

Note: You should prepare the trained caffemodel into models/FRCNN/ as ZF\_faster\_rcnn\_final.caffemodel

### Train
Using **sh examples/FRCNN/zf/train\_frcnn.sh **, the will start train voc2007 data using ZF model.

- VOCdevkit should be put into $CAFFE\_ROOT
- ln -s $YOUR\_VOCdevkit\_Path $CAFFE\_ROOT/VOCdevkit
- ZF pretrain model should be put into models/FRCNN/ as ZF.v2.caffemodel

### Test
Using **sh examples/FRCNN/zf/test\_frcnn.sh **, the will start test voc2007 test data using the trained ZF model.

- First Step of This Shell : Test all voc-2007-test images and output results in a text file.
- Second Step of This Shell : Compare the results with the ground truth file and calculate the mAP.

### Detail

Shells and prototxts for different models are listed in the examples/FRCNN and models/FRCNN

More details in the code.

### Commands, Rebase From Caffe Master

**For synchronous with official caffe**

- git remote add caffe https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git
- git fetch caffe
- git checkout master
- git rebase caffe/master

**Rebase the dev branch**
- git checkout dev
- git rebase master 
- git push -f origin dev

**QA**
- https://D-X-Y@bitbucket.org/D-X-Y/caffe-dev.git
- When Get `error: RPC failed; result=22, HTTP code = 0`, use `git config http.postBuffer 524288000`, increases git buffer to 500mb

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.
